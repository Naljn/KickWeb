        <div class="text">You came to the West to make your fortune but so far it
        has been an endless cycle of card playing, drinking
        whisky, eating beans and shooting the numerous people
        who said you smelled.
        However, your luck is about to change. It is rumoured
        that a cache of gold coins is hidden somewhere in Indian
        territory and the treasure is there for the taking - well
        almost! Just don't let the stories about the man-eating
        vultures and the terrors of the desert deter you. Okay, it
        could seriously damage your health but what kind of
        cowboy are you - lily livered? No, of course not! So, plug
        a joystick into port 1, get your spurs on and ride into the
        West.
        Oh! Silly me! I forgot. You can't afford a horse yet, can
        you? How about a sponsored walk?<br><br>

            <br>
            Use the joystick to move the cowboy. To open doors, kill
            vultures etc. touch them whilst holding the correct object.
            To pick up or drop objects position the cowboy appropri-
            ately and press the joystick button.
            Press the button to reincarnate after death, preserving
            the current object positions. Your enemies will reincar-
            nate as well though, so keep your weapons handy!
            If you find yourself in an impossible postion press
            START to begin again with the objects in their original
            positions.
            The game ends when you find the treasure. Press
            START to play again.
