      <div class="text">You came to the West to make your fortune but so far it
        has been an endless cycle of card playing, drinking
        whisky, eating beans and shooting the numerous people
        who said you smelled.
        However, your luck is about to change. It is rumoured
        that a cache of gold coins is hidden somewhere in Indian
        territory and the treasure is there for the taking - well
        almost! Just don't let the stories about the man-eating
        vultures and the terrors of the desert deter you. Okay, it
        could seriously damage your health but what kind of
        cowboy are you - lily livered? No, of course not! So, plug
        a joystick into port 1, get your spurs on and ride into the
        West.
        Oh! Silly me! I forgot. You can't afford a horse yet, can
        you? How about a sponsored walk?<br><br>

          <br>
            Use the joystick to move the cowboy. To open doors, kill
            vultures etc. touch them whilst holding the correct object.
            To pick up or drop objects position the cowboy appropri-
            ately and press the joystick button.
            Press the button to reincarnate after death, preserving
            the current object positions. Your enemies will reincar-
            nate as well though, so keep your weapons handy!
            If you find yourself in an impossible postion press
            START to begin again with the objects in their original
            positions.
            The game ends when you find the treasure. Press
            START to play again.

          <h5>TYPING IT IN</h5>
          <div class="infobox">
            Cassette and disk users should type in Listing 1, SAVE or
            CSAVE a copy, then RUN the program. The program will
            check each line of data and inform you of any errors. Correct
            any errors and RUN the program again until all errors are
            eliminated. When this is done answer the cassette/disk ques-
            tions accordingly to create a boot tape or binary disk file.
            Cassette users should load the boot tape created by fistly
            removing all cartridges and then turning on the computer
            while holding down the START key (XL and XE owners
            should hold down OPTION as well). Press RETURN and the
            tape will load an run automatically. <br>
            Disk users should clear Listing 1-from memory after saving
            and running it as above by tiping NEW and pressing RE-
            TURN. Next, type in Listing 2 and save it on the same disk
            as the binary file created by Listing 1. RUN the Listing 2
            program with the disk in the drive and the game will load and 
            run automatically.
